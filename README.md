> Smart dashboard to add, edit, delete a catlog of materials



### üè† [Homepage](https://github.com/mahir-d/smart-construction-dashboard#readme)

## Introduciton
Provides the following functionalities:
 * Allow the user to create, delete and fetch construction sites
 * Fetch the current list of materials for the current site
 * Allow the user to create, edit, and delete materials for a particular site 
 * Display the total cost of all materials for a particular site

## Database Schema
Since each material was unique for a particular construction site and not shared among other sites,
I decided to create two tables: 

1. site - Holds unique uuid for construction sites in the database 

```
site_id 
-------------
Content Cell 
Content Cell 
```

2. materials - represents material and site mapping

```
site_id       | material_id  | volume | cost   | color | delivery_date 
------------- | -------------|--------|--------|-------|---------------
uuid          | uuid         | number | number | string| datetime      

``` 

## Install
Execute the following command to load all the project dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Set up
Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project. Add
environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of `NAME=VALUE`.
Requried varibales and sample values based on Postgresql configurations

```dosini
PGHOST=localhost
PGUSER=mahirdhall
PGPASSWORD=null
PGPORT=5432
```
I have two databases set up for testing and production enviroment.
Below are sample values for the required variables. You can provide
name to both the database and Port number based on your needs
```dosini
PGDATABASE=prodDatabase
PGTESTDATABASE=testDatabase
PORT=3001
```
